# Understanding reliability in Deep Learning

The work in this module is structured as follows:

- /mnist_exploration.ipynb: This notebook runs through an analysis on the MNIST dataset and any possible connections with uncertainty.
- /creating_dataset.ipynb: Creates an unaltered and altered dataset (the latter being made out of entirely random transformations) and tests two Convolutional Models' performance on each dataset, logging the results.
- /amnist.py: Defines a CustomDataset allowing us to pass transformations to the entirity of the data.
